These Google Workspace Terms of Service (together, the "Agreement") (formerly known as "Google Workspace (Online) Agreement" or "Google Workspace Agreement") are entered into by Google and the entity or person agreeing to them ("Customer") and govern Customer's access to and use of the Services. "Google" has the meaning given at https://cloud.google.com/terms/google-entity.

This Agreement is effective when Customer clicks to accept it (the "Effective Date"). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that (i) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement.

1. Provision of the Services.
1.1 Services Use. During the Term, Google will provide the Services in accordance with the Agreement, including the SLA. Customer may use the Services ordered in the applicable Order Form or Reseller Order in accordance with this Agreement.
1.2 Admin Console. Customer will have access to the Admin Console, through which Customer may manage its use of the Services.
1.3 Accounts; Verification to Use Services.
(a) Accounts. Customer must have an Account to use the Services and is responsible for the information it provides to create the Account, the security of its passwords for the Account, and any use of its Account. Google has no obligation to provide multiple accounts to Customer.
(b) Verification to Use Services. Customer must verify a Domain Email Address or a Domain Name to use the Services. If Customer does not have valid permission to use the Domain Email Address or does not own or control the Domain Name, then Google will have no obligation to provide Customer with the Services and may delete the Account without notice.
1.4 Modifications.
(a) To the Services. Google may make commercially reasonable changes to the Services from time to time. Google will inform Customer if Google makes a material change to the Services that has a material impact on Customer's use of the Services and if Customer has subscribed with Google to be informed about such change.
(b) To the Agreement. Google may change the terms of this Agreement from time to time and will post any such changes at https://workspace.google.com/terms/premier_terms.html. These changes will only take effect at the beginning of Customer’s next Order Term, at which time Customer’s continued use of the Services will constitute its acceptance of the changes. This Section 1.4(b) (Modifications to the Agreement) does not apply to changes to URL Terms.
(c) To the URL Terms (except the Data Processing Amendment). Google may change the URL Terms from time to time and will notify Customer if any such change is material. Google may notify Customer of material SLA changes via the applicable SLA webpage. Material changes to the URL Terms will become effective 30 days after notice is given, except that (i) materially adverse SLA changes will become effective 90 days after notice is given and (ii) changes applicable to new Services or functionality will be effective immediately. This Section 1.4(c) (Modifications to the URL Terms (except the Data Processing Amendment)) does not apply to changes to the Data Processing Amendment.
(d) To the Data Processing Amendment. Google may only change the Data Processing Amendment where such change is required to comply with applicable law, is expressly permitted by the Data Processing Amendment, or:
(i) is commercially reasonable;
(ii) does not result in a material reduction of the security of the Services;
(iii) does not expand the scope of or remove any restrictions on Google's processing of "Customer Personal Data," as described in the "Scope of Processing" Section of the Data Processing Amendment; and
(iv) does not otherwise have a material adverse impact on Customer's rights under the Data Processing Amendment.
If Google makes a material change to the Data Processing Amendment in accordance with this Section 1.4(d) (Modifications to the Data Processing Amendment), Google will post the change at the webpage containing the Data Processing Amendment.
(e) Discontinuation of Core Services. Google will notify Customer at least 12 months before discontinuing any Core Service (or associated material functionality) unless Google replaces such discontinued Core Service or functionality with a materially similar Core Service or functionality. Nothing in this Section 1.4(e) (Discontinuation of Core Services) limits Google's ability to make changes required to comply with applicable law, address a material security risk, or avoid a substantial economic or material technical burden. This Section 1.4(e) (Discontinuation of Core Services) does not apply to Other Services or to pre-general availability Services, offerings, or functionality.
2. Payment Terms.
2.1 Usage Measurement and Billing Options. Google’s measurement tools will be used to determine Customer’s usage of the Services and any such determination by Google for the purpose of calculating Fees is final. Customer may elect one of the billing options below or any other option offered by Google when Customer places its order for the Services.
(a) Flexible Plan. If Customer selects this option, Customer will not be committed to purchase the Services for a pre-defined term, but will pay Fees based on its daily usage of the Services, billed monthly in arrears. Any partial day of Services usage will be rounded up to a full day of Services usage for the purposes of calculating Fees.
(b) Annual/Fixed-Term Plan. If Customer selects this option, Customer will be committed to purchasing the Services for one or more annual terms (as selected by Customer). Google will bill Customer according to the terms associated with Customer’s elections on the Order Form.
Google may change its offering of billing options (including by limiting or ceasing to offer any billing option) upon 30 days’ notice to Customer and any such change will take effect at the beginning of Customer’s next Order Term. Billing options may not be available to all customers. Customer may pay for the Services using the payment options listed in Section 2.2 (Payment) below.
2.2 Payment. All payments are due in the currency stated on the Order Form or invoice.
(a) Credit Card or Debit Card. If Customer is paying with a credit card, debit card, or other non-invoice form of payment payments are due at the end of the month during which Customer received the Services. For credit cards or debit cards, as applicable: (i) Google will issue an electronic bill for all applicable Fees when due, and (ii) these Fees are considered overdue 30 days after the end of the month during which Customer received the Services.
(b) Invoices. Payments for invoices are due 30 days after the invoice date (unless otherwise specified on the Order Form) and are considered overdue after such date.
(c) Other Forms of Payment. Customer may change its payment method to any other method that Google may enable in the Admin Console, subject to acceptance by Customer of any additional terms applicable to that payment method.
(d) Payment Information. Payments made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by Google.
2.3 Taxes.
(a) Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and will pay Google for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Google is obligated to collect or pay any Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer and Customer will pay such Taxes to Google, unless Customer provides Google with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate in respect of those Taxes.
(b) Customer will provide Google with any applicable tax identification information that Google may require under applicable law to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. Customer will be liable to pay (or reimburse Google for) any taxes, interest, penalties, or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by Customer.
2.4 Payment Disputes. Any payment disputes must be submitted before the payment due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to Google, Google will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If a disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Google will apply the credit memo amount to the disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due on that invoice. Nothing in this Agreement obligates Google to extend credit to any party.
2.5 Delinquent Payments; Suspension. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Google in collecting such delinquent amounts. Further, if Customer’s payment for the Services is overdue, Google may Suspend the Services.
2.6 No Purchase Order Number Required. Customer is obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for Google to provide a purchase order number on Google's invoice (or otherwise).
2.7 Price Revisions. Google may change the Prices at any time unless otherwise expressly agreed in an addendum or Order Form. Google will notify Customer at least 30 days in advance of any changes. Customer's pricing will change at the beginning of Customer’s next Order Term after the 30-day period.
3. Customer Obligations.
3.1 Compliance. Customer will (a) ensure that Customer and its End Users' use of the Services complies with the Agreement, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent and terminate any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Services, and (c) promptly notify Google if Customer becomes aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Services, Account, or Customer's password. Google reserves the right to investigate any potential violation of the AUP by Customer, which may include reviewing Customer Data.

3.4 Additional Products. Google makes optional Additional Products available to Customer and its End Users. Use of Additional Products is subject to the Additional Product Terms. Customer can enable or disable Additional Products at any time through the Admin Console.
3.5 Administration of Services. Customer may specify through the Admin Console one or more Administrators who will have the right to access Admin Accounts. Customer is responsible for (a) maintaining the confidentiality and security of the End User Accounts and associated passwords and (b) any use of the End User Accounts. Customer agrees that Google’s responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Services for Customer or any End Users.
3.6 Abuse Monitoring. Customer is solely responsible for monitoring, responding to, and otherwise processing emails sent to the "abuse" and "postmaster" aliases for Customer Domain Names, but Google may monitor emails sent to these aliases to allow Google to identify Services abuse.
3.7 Requesting Additional End User Accounts During Order Term. Customer may purchase additional End User Accounts during an Order Term by means of an additional Order Form or Reseller Order or by ordering via the Admin Console. Such additional End User Accounts will have a pro-rated term ending on the last day of the applicable Order Term.
4. Suspension.
4.1 AUP Violations. If Google becomes aware that Customer's or any End User's use of the Services violates the AUP, Google will notify Customer and request that Customer correct the violation. If Customer fails to correct the violation within 24 hours of Google's request, then Google may Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the Services until the violation is corrected. Suspension of the Services may include removal or unsharing of content that violates the AUP.
4.2 Other Suspension. Notwithstanding Section 4.1 (AUP Violations), Google may immediately Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the Services (including use of the underlying Account) if (a) Google reasonably believes Customer's or any End User's use of the Services could adversely impact the Services, other customers' or their end users' use of the Services, or the Google network or servers used to provide the Services; (b) there is suspected unauthorized third-party access to the Services; (c) Google reasonably believes that immediate Suspension is required to comply with any applicable law; or (d) Customer is in breach of Section 3.3 (Restrictions) or the Service Specific Terms. Google will lift any such Suspension when the circumstances giving rise to the Suspension have been resolved. At Customer's request, Google will, unless prohibited by applicable law, notify Customer of the basis for the Suspension as soon as is reasonably possible.

Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, this Agreement does not grant either party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the other's content or any of the other's intellectual property.

Certain TSS levels include a minimum recurring Fee as described at https://workspace.google.com/terms/tssg.html.

The recipient will ensure that its Delegates use the received Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement.
